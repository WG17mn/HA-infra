# HA-infra

This repo contains a HA infrastructure provisioned with Terraform along with a user-data file. The Terraform creates an infra that is similar to the AWS implementation below.

Due to some technical issues faced with the ansible deployment implementation, I've limited the architecture to use a user-data or demo purposes. However, future work would include a web app deployed through Ansible playbook. Additionally, Docker could be used to package the app and remove dependencies related issues.

## Tools used
 - AWS;
 - Terraform;
 - ~~Ansible~~ user-data file(deployment.sh);

## Launch Instructions
terraform init

terraform plan

terraform apply

curl -X GET load-balancer-dns-name
